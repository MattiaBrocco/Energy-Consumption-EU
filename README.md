# Energy Consumption EU
Data analysis and data visualization of pollution trend in the European Union according to Eurostat data for the period 2009-2016.  
First University Project in Python (2020). Further modification for leaner code have been applied in 2022.  
Worked on `folium` choropleth and icon maps

We've considered emissions under different point of views:
* Cars GHG emissions
* Livestock GHG emissions
* GHG emissions from industrial sectors
* Use of chemical fertilizers
Finally, we've tried to assess to which extent the EU area is putting effort in reneweable energies investments.
